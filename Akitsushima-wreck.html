                <h2>About the Akitsushima Wreck</h2>
                <p class="wreckp">
                    The Akitsushima Wreck is a former Japanese seaplane tender sunk during a massive U.S. air raid in Coron Bay, Palawan, on September 24, 1944. Originally built as a naval warship, this 118-meter-long vessel played a crucial role in supporting flying boat operations across the Pacific. Today, it stands as one of the most impressive and historically significant wreck dive sites around Busuanga Island. It is located near another notable wreck, the Okikawa Maru, making this area a favorite for wreck diving enthusiasts.

The Akitsushima now rests on her port side at a depth of around 36 meters, with the shallowest parts, such as parts of the superstructure, accessible at about 22 meters. While the ship was severely damaged during the attack, much of its structure remains intact, allowing divers to explore various parts of the wreck. The most notable feature is the massive crane once used to launch and retrieve a seaplane, likely the Aichi E13A “Jake,” which was lost during the explosion when the ship was hit near the stern and sank rapidly.

There are multiple penetration points on the wreck, including access to the large and fascinating engine room where divers can view the powerful machinery and four large engines that once powered this warship. Inside, you’ll find a haunting yet captivating atmosphere—steel beams, twisted ladders, and remnants of naval engineering all covered in coral and marine growth. Due to the depth and complexity, these penetrations should only be attempted by advanced divers with proper training and wreck diving certification.

Marine life around the Akitsushima is moderate but interesting. Barracudas, tunas, and batfish are commonly seen cruising around the wreck, along with occasional sightings of lionfish and groupers. While not as densely populated with fish as some shallower reefs, the wreck offers a dramatic underwater landscape filled with rich historical value and vibrant coral growth including soft corals, sponges, and gorgonian fans that thrive on the metal surfaces.

Because of its depth and occasional strong currents, diving the Akitsushima is recommended only for advanced divers or those diving with Nitrox to safely extend bottom time. Visibility can vary but is often good, making it a favorite for underwater photographers and history lovers alike. This dive site offers a unique opportunity to explore a real piece of World War II naval history resting silently beneath the waters of Coron Bay.

                <h2>About the Kyokuzan Maru Wreck</h2>
                <p class="wreckp"> The Kyokuzan Maru is a Japanese cargo ship classified as an Army Auxiliary Vessel that was sunk on the 24th of September 1944 during a
                     United States air strike in World War II as part of the larger offensive against the Japanese fleet anchored near Busuanga Island in Coron Bay Palawan
                      the ship measures around 136 meters or 450 feet in length and now lies upright on the sandy seabed in relatively good condition making it one of the
                       best-preserved wrecks in the region and a favorite among divers due to its accessibility and clarity of structure the wreck’s shallower sections begin 
                       at the mast area which is located at approximately 12 to 14 meters deep offering a perfect entry point for divers and snorkelers who wish to observe the upper 
                       features of the vessel the wheelhouse rests slightly deeper between 22 and 24 meters and is often one of the most photographed parts of the ship due to its intact 
                       layout and rich coral cover moving further down the main deck lies between 26 and 28 meters where divers can start to appreciate the scale of the ship and the 
                       diverse marine life that inhabits it including groupers batfish and colorful anthias the first-level cargo holds begin around 30 to 33 meters where divers often
                        discover scattered remnants of wartime cargo such as bottles construction materials and machinery the maximum depth of the wreck reaches 42 meters which allows
                         for deeper technical dives and advanced exploration particularly in the lower cargo sections and engine spaces due to its depth range and the complexity of internal
                          structures the Kyokuzan Maru is best suited for advanced divers or those diving with Nitrox to extend bottom time and increase safety the wreck is covered in both hard
                           and soft corals with sponges sea fans and crinoids adding vibrant color while large schools of snapper trevally and barracuda frequently patrol the site visibility is
                            often excellent compared to other wrecks in the area and current conditions are generally mild making it an ideal site not only for wreck diving but also for 
                            underwater photography and historical exploration the Kyokuzan Maru lies northeast of Busuanga Island and takes about one and a half hours by banca boat from 
                            Coron town making
                     it a worthwhile day trip for divers looking to experience one of the most visually stunning and historically rich wrecks in the Philippines.



                    The Kyokuzan Maru is a Japanese freighter sunk during World War II, lying off the coast of Busuanga Island near Coron, Palawan. 
                    This impressive wreck is situated at a depth of 22 to 29 meters, offering a unique and relatively undisturbed dive site. 
                    Known for its size and intact structure, the Kyokuzan Maru provides divers with an extraordinary underwater adventure.
